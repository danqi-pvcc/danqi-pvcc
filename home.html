      <p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a department parallel to Department of Justice (DOJ),Department of State, Department of Defense (DOD), Homeland Security Council, Homeland Security Council, Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Energy (DOE), Depart of the Treasury. DHS established in 2001. The main reason is that after 9/11 terrorist attacks, President Bush proposed the Homeland Security Act, which aimed to establish a centralized and unified agency responsible for coordinating and overseeing matters related to homeland security. DHS main assignment include, preventing and responding to terrorist threats, Securing national borders to prevent illegal immigration and smuggling activities, Responding to emergency and natural disasters, Collecting, analyzing and sharing domestic security intelligence, Coordinating efforts across deportments in the realm of homeland security. The DHS has several components, including various agencies, offices, and bureaus. </p>
      <p>Here are some of the main department under the DHS: </p>
      <p><b> Homeland Security Headquarters: </b> This headquarters is responsible for overall leadership and coordination of various departments within the Department of Homeland Security</p>
      <p><b>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP): </b>Responsible for border and customs enforcement, as well as tasks related to trade security.</p>

      <p>In our daily lives, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays a crucial role that is often closer to us than we might realize. Whether we embark on a vacation, undertake a business trip, or simply board a plane, the ubiquitous presence of security personnel at airports conducting identity checks and inspecting packages serves as a visible manifestation of DHS's influence. Additionally, individuals working to prevent illegal immigration at the U.S. border are often part of the Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a branch agency under DHS. For those navigating the intricacies of immigration processes, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), another branch of DHS, becomes a pivotal point of contact. Notably, while USCIS handles the applications of legal immigrants for visas or green cards, it is essential to recognize that the issuance of U.S. passports for citizens falls under the purview of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, not USCIS.In times of natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or floods, DHS officers communicate with the media and disseminate pertinent policies. It is important to note, however, that the management of disease pandemics lies within the jurisdiction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an entity distinct from DHS; the CDC operates under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).Beyond these facets directly impacting our daily lives, there exist crucial but less overtly encountered aspects of DHS's responsibilities, including counter-terrorism efforts and territorial protection. These tasks, though less conspicuous in our day-to-day experiences, underscore the multifaceted role that the Department of Homeland Security plays in ensuring the safety and security of the nation.
